# The Freelancing Dream

## The Good Part of Freelancing

Freedom

## The Bad Part of Freelancing

> The biggest hurdle to freelancing was that it has a very atypical cost of admission. Before earning a decent income and starting to see satisfying levels of success, you will struggle and it will hurt. You will apply for projects and no one will every reply back to you. You will be rejected over and over and over again, and most of you will quit right there and then. But those that will keep digging, keep trying will eventually get a break, and from that point on, it only gets easier.

> **While you will earn more for your time than most jobs offer**, you will have your own rules.

> You need to handle everything. Invoicing, sales, marketing, lead generation, managing client relationships, setting deadlines and doing the actual work.

# Setup

## Your Brand

Consider getting a custom designed logo or buy a stock logo (graphicriver.net)

## Your Website

Having a website is NOT mandatory

## Getting Clients

Clients want four things:
- Proof of skill (portfolio)
- Trust (testimonials, references, portfolio)
- Understanding. It's your role to determine what's important to the client
- Differentiators

## Freelancing Websites

Recommended Platforms
- Upwork
- PeoplePerHour
- Freelancer

The most important part of the work is to apply to projects. Here is where 90% of people fail. Not because they don't write good proposals, not because they don't have enough experience, but because they don't write enough proposals. Most people quit early.

Apply only on fresh projects. People make up their minds on the first proposals. If a project is already listed for **three days** and has lots of applications, don't even waste your time.
