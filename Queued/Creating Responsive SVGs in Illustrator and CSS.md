# Creating Responsive SVGs in ILlustrator and CSS

## Designing the First Icon

When making a new document, make sure to select `Color Mode: RGB` in the advanced settings. According to author, `RGB` is meant for web-based projects while `CMYK` is meant for something print-based.

Create a rectangle using the rounded rectangle tool. When creating the rectangle, you can see the dimensions to the right of the cursor, so you could technically create an exact match of the rectangle created by the author.

In the menu just below the top menu, there's an option to increase the stroke width.

You can move the rectangle you just created with the arrow keys.

There's a magnifying glass tool in the left panel. You can use it to highlight an area of the page and it will zoom in on that area (beats using ctrl + and ctrl -). If you're unhappy with your zoom, do ctrl + 0 then try again.

If you click on the shape, you can manually type in the dimensions. For some reason this creates a 2nd shape instead of modifying the 1st.

In the bottom of the left panel, there's a white square. Click on it, then in the top-right corner, click a square with a diagonal red slash through it. This gets rid of the fill.

Supposedly, to deselect you need to hold Ctrl then do a left click.

If you click layers on the bottom-right, you will see Layer 1 with two rectangles nested inside.

To copy a shape, do `ctrl + c`, `ctrl + f`, then drag the new shape to wherever you want it positioned. If you want to maintain alignment with the previous shape, hold `shift`.

To adjust the rounded corners of the rounded rectangle, go to `View -> Show Corner Widget`, then drag one of the four circle icons just inside of the corner. Note: You could also just select the rectangle with the selection tool and do the same.

To adjust the rounded rectangle's height, use the direct selection tool (A), hold shift, select the top 4 corners then use either the vertical arrow keys or drag with the mouse.

Can create perfectly horizontal, vertical or diagonal lines by using the line selection tool and holding shift.

Technique for copying the line: `Ctrl + C`, `Ctrl + F`, arrow keys to move the new object.

Can chain together `Ctrl + C`, `Ctrl + F` to make multiple copies of the shape.

Before scaling a line, make sure to go to `Window -> Transform` and make sure `Scale Strokes & Effects` isn't on (it wasn't for me by default)

You'll be switching to the selection tool a lot. Fortunately, the shortcut for this is simply the `V` key. You can find this out by hovering on any of the icons in the left panel.

When in the selection tool, clicking away from the selection deselects it, no need to hold `Ctrl`.

The shortcut for the zoom tool is `Z`.

When you try and select a lot of items, sometimes the background also gets selected. To fix this, hold shift and click somewhere on the background.
