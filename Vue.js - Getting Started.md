# Introducing Vue.js

## Introducing Vue.js

> I decided to write this course because I believe that Vue.js is a breath of fresh air in the increasingly complex world of web development

- Vue.js has an emphasis on simplicity and speed
- This lets you focus on web apps that run **fast**
- (Over 2 hours we code a brewery social network application)

## The Simplicity of Vue

It is the jQuery of frameworks. It exists to facilitate usage, to use the APIs at a higher level of reasoning (my words).

- Templates
- Declarative binding

## Running Fast with Vue

Both Vue and React make use of a Virtual DOM to improve efficiency
