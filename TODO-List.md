# Alert

## For Christ's sake, stop taking Pluralsight courses and just start writing a full stack application of your own. You are more than capable of learning via official documentation, blog posts and common sense.

## Learn about the basics of Redux and Mongoose / MongoDB and build an app using React + Webpack + Redux + MongoDB as your technology stack. Just stick to this stack and don't think about it. Changing your technology stack constantly is procrastination. LEARN BY DOING. You are ready.

## This is all just a means to an end. Stop obsessing over your technology stack and remember that your ultimate goal is to build shit.

# Priorities

###### Freelance as a full-stack developer

Goal: Make minimum 75$/hour and never be short on work

Actions to take
- Set up a few portfolio **web applications** (ex/ a Twitter clone)
- Apply to more freelancing sites (blocker: worried about inexperience and lack of portfolio material)
- Apply for Github remote jobs (the salaries listed are kind of insane, especially if they are in USD!)
- Stick to React + Node/Express + Redux as your full stack and find a DB solution you're satisfied with -- will require some experimentation
- Take some courses on database design
- Re-purpose your LinkedIn profile and maybe your resume on sites like LinkedIn
- Publish that blog post on Toptal
- Write to your blog more frequently
- Consider outsourcing your front-end work so you can focus on the backend. At the very least, hire a designer to send you PSD mockups.

###### Improve my web development workflow

Actions to take
- Write your own command line utility for generating boilerplate files for you. You can probably write this shell script using Python!
- Write an npm starter package (good opportunity to write a blog post, maybe get some open source attention)
- Figure out some type of setup where you can import certain parts of Bootstrap, like just using the grid system

###### Don't spend all my time programming

Actions to take
- Walk on Mount Royal at least an hour per day
- Don't read `reddit.com/r/programmerhumor`
- Start going to the gym again
- Read some travel blogs -> Look to get really excited about life outside of programming!
- Improve your French and learn Spanish. Bonus of added social skills (people love talking about languages & culture)
- Invest more in cooking -> Follow some recipes, buy better kitchenware
- Sign up for more classes -> Improv was such a hit, why not acting lessons next?
- Don't bring your laptop to bed

###### Improve my React Knowledge

Actions to take
- Learn more about React animations
- Participate in the React community (ex/ actually read the newsletter)
- Try out a bunch of React npm plugins

###### Learn ES6

Actions to take
- Compare the two Pluralsight courses on the topic and commit fully to one of them
- Read up on some blogs to see if there are any features you missed

###### Learn Firebase

Actions to take
- Learn it directly from the official docs or blog posts
- Heavily concerned about the data duplication vs using relational database joins issue

###### Learn Redux

Actions to take
- Wait for Cory House to release his new course (coming out early May)

###### Learn About JavaScript Unit Testing

Actions to take
- Take the Pluralsight course related to JavaScript testing in your bookmarks
- Read up on test driven development (wouldn't hurt to practice it as well)
- Unit testing isn't even necessarily that important to learn unless you're building large-scale applications

###### Learn More About jQuery Best Practices

Actions to take
- Take some jQuery related Pluralsight courses (in fact, I have a few in progress already)
- There's no real point in doing this unless you REALLy care about animations in your UI
