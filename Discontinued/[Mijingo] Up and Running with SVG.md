# Part 1

SVG is short for Scalable Vector Graphics. It is an XML language and file format. It allows you to code two-dimensional graphics that scale.

> "If you already know how to use JavaScript and HTML for web-programming, the learning curve will be pretty gentle, particularly in view of the benefits gained." - W3.org SVG Primer

Why should I use SVG?
- Scalable (can enlarge an SVG without loss of quality or fidelity)
- File size (Mijingo logo is 30KB as a png and only 6KB as an svg)
- Modifiable via CSS and JavaScript

The tools we'll use
- Adobe Illustrator (or similar tool like Sketch)
- CodePen.io
