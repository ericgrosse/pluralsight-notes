# Introduction

The course walks you through creating a Twitter clone.

Some of the technologies used:
PostgreSQL - Feature-rich open-source database, which plays very well with Rails
Materialize - Alternative to Bootstrap, author thinks it looks a lot better

# The Basicas of Rails and React.js

## Introduction

Author is going to show us how to pre-render our components on the server

## Installing Tools

Author shows some neat tricks in the Mac's `iTerm2` terminal

Make sure to download Ruby and Postgres

You have to manually add Postgres to your PATH variables

```
C:\Program Files\PostgreSQL\9.5\bin
```

(Make sure to use the correct version in the path name)

After doing this, typing `psql` into the terminal should launch Postgres.

As a further complication, you have to do:

```
psql -U postgres
```

You might also have to create a user called eric, not 100% sure about this.

## Running on Rails 5.0

[Currently here, you should really take a Ruby on Rails course before continuing though, also use a Mac instead of Windows and you'll have a much easier time]
